# cozy crafter
### keeps track of your knitting or crochet projects

This project will be a simple desktop program which will help keep track of knitting or crochet by:
- keep a library of projects
- remembering active projects, abandoned projects, and finished projects
- keep count of rows and stitches of individual projects as they are updated by the user 

I decided to make this project to help me brush up my python skills, learn some GUI skills, practice data persistence/database junk, and to develop an easy offline way for me to keep track of my fiber art hobby. :)

#### todo:
- add gui
- add stitch counting function for active project
