### cozy crafter
## keeps track of your knitting or crochet projects

This project will be a simple desktop program which will help keep track of knitting or crochet by:
- keep a library of projects
- remembering active projects, abandoned projects, and finished projects
- keep count of rows and stitches of individual projects as they are updated by the user 

I decided to make this project to help me brush up my python skills, learn some GUI skills, and to develop an easy offline way for me to keep track of my fiber art hobby. :)

Ths project is still in very early stages. As of 19Jun2023 it has no functionality.
